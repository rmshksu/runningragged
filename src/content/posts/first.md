My first attempt at maintaining a blog didn't go over as planned.

I failed to set it up in a way that was convenient for me to edit. That's not to say that quarto blogs aren't *incredible*â€” they're just clunky to build and maintain. I also failed to structure the posting schedules in a way that excited me thoroughly. Which is a problem because I pretty much rely on being interested in something to engage with it in any way. It's definitely a character flaw, not being able to force myself into doing things I have no interest in doing, but one I have to accept rather than fight against.

This time around I've made improvements. A fresh new look, a more accessible editing format, and a clear purpose to the blog besides documenting my gradual descent into madness. I'm not sure why I didn't think of it before but I'm just going to use this blog as a chance to work on all of my little side projects one piece at a time. 

I've got 4 (four) major side projects that I want to open up and begin working through on this blog. All of them are based in programming, math, and statistics (one way or another) because my inability to maintain work-life balance can't be looked down on if work is *also* my hobby.

### C(++)-Distributed

- I'll be cosplaying as a real programmer. Not well, but I'll be doing it.

---

### Confidently Wrong

- See: Elements of Statistical Learning by Jerome H. Friedman, Robert Tibshirani, and Trevor Hastie

        - We're gonna use that to make fun of Gemini and Grok

---

### Qualified

- Math. Upsetting amounts of math.

### War(craft)

- Witness the death of any remaining work//life boundaries I had as I develop models to help my friends play a game better.
