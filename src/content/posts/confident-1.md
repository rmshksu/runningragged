Large language models, generative artificial intelligence, neural networks, random forests, and deep learning. 

All the grotesque buzz words that LinkedInfluences and python cultists throw at the wall anytime someone brings up statistics. I make fun of them, relentlessly, but I don't feel very justified since I'm not extremely versed in the field of machine learning.

This project is a mash-up of three things I've been needing to do:

1. Walk through the history of machine learning models

2. Finally read Elements of Statistical Learning

3. Call out 'AI' platforms for their horrendous model outputs

I don't have the patience to sit in a classroom when it comes to this topic. I have no desire to study it. Big Data pisses me off because it's primarily an effort in cleaning data (not my job) and adjusting for the fact that every other entry is a mis-measurement (not something the data broker will ever fucking admit). My money (research hours, I'm a broke grad student) is invested in small data and that's not going to change anytime soon. 

That said, it's important stuff to learn so I guess I'll just do it in public. For fun.
