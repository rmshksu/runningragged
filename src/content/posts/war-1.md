If it weren't for COVID, I wouldn't have picked up World of Warcraft as a hobby. If it weren't for World of Warcraft, I wouldn't be a statistician. 

I've been learning statistics and playing the game long enough that it's high time I finally break down the last shoddy safeguard of my mental health. I want to develop some models for in-game performance using the *mammoth* quantity of data found in Warcraft logs. 

This one is going to be particularly challenging from a 'data science' perspective because Warcraft logs .csv files are dirtier than the toilet seats in the singular bathroom at a college nightclub. But this is also a great chance for me to play around with some fun ideas I've had for (actually impactful and scientific) research that I'd never be able to test drive otherwise.
