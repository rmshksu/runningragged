This is really the first part of an even larger side project: my decision science (or whatever the fuck we're calling statistics on LinkedIn now) function repository, Alexandria. 

I like the idea of Alexandria because it leverages my love for good documentation (which is realistically anything that isn't the Arch Linux wiki, those doc maintainers should all be ashamed of themselves) and marries it with my passion for never opening stack overflow unless I'm being held at gun point. 

The idea I've had for a while is setting up a series of .cpp executables that I can string together in a frankenstein array to inevitably run custom Bayesian models. I have an aversion to using libraries that I can't assure will be alive and well by the end of my career so it'll be an exploration on my part to locate the ones I can trust. 

I'll also have to properly educate myself on object oriented programming, a phrase that I've never heard someone explain well without using a condescending tone.
