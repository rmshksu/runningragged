My department uses a qualifying examination to determine who gets to be a Ph.D. student in the department. It's a semi-standard practice, especially in math and stats programs, but we're lagging behind on some things that other departments and Universities have in place by default.

One is the fact that the majority of the grad students in my department can't decide what the hell the exam is. Some say the quals are a 6 hour exam stretched over 1 year of coursework with the intent on making newcomers jump through hoops, exclusively for the plot.

Some believe the quals to be easy and an assumption of knowledge that should be met prior to walking through the doors (at the risk of sounding like a hypocrite, that's an insane thing to say). 

The rest vaguely fall into the category of seeing the quals as a necessary evil. The exam is tough because it contains the full breadth of '2 AM knowledge' (as in I shake you awake at 2 AM and ask you a question you should be able to rapidly answer) that any statistician worth their salt should obtain. The process of preparing for the exam is meant to weed out the ones who don't wish to be there and 'boot camp' the ones who do.

I disagree with all three. 

1. The exam is not an elaborate hazing scheme (I hope) because if it was I guarantee a team of professional statisticians could come up with something less elaborate and more evil. 

2. The knowledge of the exam isn't a valid assumption because it's incoherently stupid to assume that a Ph.D. program is such a confirmatory exercise of knowledge that nobody ever gets a Doctorate that significantly differs from their previous degrees.

3. There's no obvious connection between students who do well with the quals and high quality Ph.D. students in the department. I believe, if we reported the data, most high school algebra students could prove this to be true with a line of best fit. More importantly *I took the exams*. If I ever have to use more than 30% of that information I'll be deeply concerned about how my career could have gone so wrong that I work for a Department of Mathematics as a lecturing professor for engineering maths. 

The good news is that the problem with the exam, I believe, is easy to say. The bad news is that it's awful to produce.

We need a god damn study guide. So that's what I intend to produce. Not because I care about passing those exams (see 3. above) but because I *love* educating. I imagine the primary reason my department lacks a study guide, unlike most departments with an analogous qualifying exam, is because we're a small group and spread razor thin. Luckily I have passion, minor capability, and horrible boundaries with my free time.
