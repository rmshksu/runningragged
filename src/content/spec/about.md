# About
This is my personal blog where I empty my shower thoughts, highlight my inability to properly program anything, and avoid asking silly questions like "Do I really need 5 fucking for loops for this?" or "Is it possible that a nested list of nested lists is sub-optimal structure?".

Sometimes I'll do light research. I guess. Never trigonometry though.

All code that doesn't horrifically break or embarass me ends up in my alexandria repo:
